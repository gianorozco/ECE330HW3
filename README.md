# ECE330HW3
This repository contains 2 versions of a Heart Rate Calculator: 
  One that uses variables as arguments to send to the class constructor
  One that overloads operator ">>" to send arguments to a default constructor
Note: The overloaded operator version was entirely optional
One can easily compile the code by using the makefiles associated within the directory
All invalid inputs, except the name and the year for both the birth date and current date, have been accounted for
